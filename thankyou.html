  <h1>While making this, I wasn’t even sure if you’d ever see it...</h1>
  <p>
    You could’ve just kept the scrapbook aside and never opened it. <br>
    Or maybe shut it halfway out of boredom...
  </p>
  <p>
    What if you had never accepted the scrapbook? <br><br>
    What if you had left for your internship without meeting me... or even telling me? <br><br>
    So many *what ifs* that would’ve kept haunting me. <br><br>
    Thank you for not letting that happen, bhiduu.
  </p>
  <p>
    This website will take just 5 minutes of your time. <br><br>
    And no — it’s not some emotional trap to make you come back. <br><br>
    Everyone deserves good company, good friends, and an environment where they can truly grow. <br><br>
    You should never have to compromise on that.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is just my way of saying **thank you** —<br><br>
    For all the little compromises you’ve made while being my friend. <br><br>
    You genuinely deserve this.<br><br>
